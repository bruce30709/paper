# On Performance Evaluation of Random Access Enhancements for 5G uRLLC
## Terms
<span class="green">**Factory of the Future(FOF)**</span>
:::success
The factory of the future is a vision for how manufacturers should enhance production by making improvements in three dimensions: plant structure, plant digitization, and plant processes.
:::

<span class="green">**random access channel (RACH)**</span>
:::success
The Random Access Channel (RACH) is an uplink transmission used by the UE to initiate synchronization with the eNodeB.
:::
<span class="green">**backoff**</span>
:::success
什麼是Backoff，這其實不是一個新的機制了，這個機制在乙太網路初期就已經廣泛使用了，802.11 wifi也有類似的機制，所謂的Backoff，就是在傳輸碰撞環境，當兩個競爭者碰撞到的時候會做一個退後傳送的機制，這個退後是指等待一段時間再次進行傳送。在LTE之中是會有backoff的因為當兩個UE同時要傳送時，是有可能會互相做碰撞的。這個時候就是在傳送Random Access的時候。
:::
<span class="green">**Zadoff-Chu(ZC)**</span>
:::success
Zadoff-Chu sequences exhibit the useful property that cyclically shifted versions of themselves are orthogonal to one another, provided that each cyclic shift.
:::
<span class="green">**Frequency division duplexing (FDD)**</span>
:::success
Frequency division duplexing (FDD) FDD allows uplink and downlink transmission at the same time, but over different frequency bands. The bands are typically separated by a large margin to avoid leakage. FDD creates a channel that is always available and thus does not incur any delay.

## I. Introduction


### A. State-of-the-Art
<span class="blue">**early data transmission (EDT) by 3GPP**</span>
:::info
In EDT, the uplink grant for data is sent early, thus allowing data transmission to be piggybacked with RACH procedure.
:::
<span class="blue">**new radio(NR)**</span>
:::info

NR需要使用LTE以外的新無線電接取技術——它必須夠靈活，以支持從小於6GHz到高達100GHz的毫米波(mmWave)頻段的更寬範圍頻帶。NR已經選擇了基於OFDM的統一且更有能力的空中介面完成以後的任務。

### B. Contributions and Outline
<span class="blue">**Contributions**</span>
:::info
• We provide an overview of the existing RA enhancements
that are particularly attractive for uRLLC applications.
Such enhancements include EDT, the use of flexible
numerology and reserved preambles.

• We propose three new RA enhancements for uRLLC
which have been designed to fulfil the requirements of
FoF applications. The proposed enhancement include
parallel preamble transmission, enhanced back-off and
dynamic reserved preamble techniques.

• We develop a realistic system-level simulator to evaluate different RA enhancements. The simulator has been
validated against the widely used 3GPP model.

• We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation
of the existing as well as proposed RA enhancements.
Performance has been bench-marked against standard
LTE RA procedure.

## II. STANDARD RACH PROCEDURE
:::warning
![](https://i.imgur.com/Rarl0PJ.png)

1. In system information block (SIB2), the next generation node B (gNB) periodically broadcasts several parameters such as root sequence ID, RACH configuration index, power offset, and initial power.

2. In a contention based RACH procedure, the device randomly selects a preamble out of the 54 orthogonal zadoff-chu (ZC) sequences generated by root sequence cyclic shift. This is transmitted as Msg 1 on the RA subframe in time and resource block (RB) in frequency implicitly defining the RA-radio network temporary identifier (RA-RNTI).

3. The gNB responds with Msg 2 random access response (RAR) containing a temporary cell-RNTI (C-RNTI), timing advance (TA) and uplink resource grant upon Msg 1 success.

4. In Msg 3, the device transmits a radio resource control (RRC) connection request including a randomly chosen initial device identity after decoding the RB assignment from Msg 2. Multiple devices can select the same preamble, RA-RNTI in Msg 1 and also the corresponding C-RNTI in Msg 2 and transmit their own Msg 3 on the uplink resources which is detected as a collision by gNB.

5. In Msg 4, the gNB sends RRC connection setup with a permanent C-RNTI and an echo of the initial identity transmitted in Msg 3 by the device. RACH procedure is considered as a success if the identities are matched else the device retries the procedure after a back-off interval. The successful device is ready to transmit uplink data.

## III. EXISTING RA ENHANCEMENTS FOR URLLC

### A. EDT
:::warning
![](https://i.imgur.com/7r1Eh3X.png)
EDT Msg 1 carries the standard LTE RACH Msg 1 and Msg 3 i.e. preamble followed by the data (connection request, device ID, buffer status report) as shown in Fig. 2. EDT Msg 2 corresponds to the Msg 2 and Msg 4 of standard LTE RACH.
:::

### B. Reserved Preambles
:::warning
![](https://i.imgur.com/RVogJZL.png)
Priority is set via preamble reservation for uRLLC devices and the total number of reserved preambles is given by r.
:::
### C. Flexible Numerology
:::warning
The subcarrier spacing (15 kHz for LTE) is configurable to 30/60/120 kHz in the frequency domain. The number of symbols per slot (7 symbols for LTE) can also be configured to mini-slots with 4 or 2 symbols.
