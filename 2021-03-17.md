NFV is a promising technology to provide cost-effective service customization. In NFV, different NFs are decoupled from dedicated network servers, and virtualized as software instances running on high-capacity commodity servers placed in various network locations.

## I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to solve a joint VNF-CC and VNF-FGE problem. The objective is to find a feasible VNF chain composition and embedding with low computational complexity, while minimizing the embedding cost and increasing the number of accommodated simultaneously. The proposed heuristic consists of two stages: In the first stage, an order of VNFs to compose the VNF-FG is determined for minimizing the embedding cost. After this stage, the order of VNFs and the capacity constraints of the initial VNF-FG are determined. In the second stage, the heuristic algorithm tries to allocate resources to the virtual nodes and links in the VNF-FG. If certain nodes are overloaded, a node splitting mechanism is employed to modify the VNF-FG determined in the first stage. The proposed approach improves the resource utilization of the network, with an increased service acceptance ratio.

## II. SYSTEM MODEL
### Substrate network
G = (N,L) with set N of physical nodes and set L of physical transmission links.
c(n) as the available CPU processing capacity of substrate node n, ∀n ∈ N.
F be the set of available VNFs in the substrate network
Let H(n) be a set of VNFs of different types that substrate node n can host.
b(l) as the bandwidth capacity of link l, ∀l ∈ L.
P represent the set of all the substrate paths (each path contains a set of links between two substrate nodes) in G.
b(P) denote the available bandwidth capacity of a substrate path P ∈ P.
### VNF request (VNFR)
Suppose that there are J service requests. For the j-th VNF request Vj , j = 1,..., J, the following information is required [9]: 1) The set of VNFs
with dependency Fj = {fj1 , fj2 ,...,fj|Fj |}, where |Fj | is the number of VNFs in Vj ; 2) Source and destination substrate nodes for Vj , represented by ns and nd (we focus on unicastcommunications), respectively; 3) Initial data rate dr entering the chained functions; 4) The ratio of outgoing data rate over incoming data rate r(fji ) of each VNF fji , i = 1,..., |Fj |; 5)
The processing resource demand per bandwidth unit p(fji ) of each VNF fji .
### VNF-FG
Given the information of a VNFR, a VNF-FG can be composed in different orders. We denote a VNF-FG by a directed graph G = (N, L). Denote the VNF to which the virtual node n ∈ N corresponds by f(n). Let c(n) denote the CPU processing resource requirement on n ∈ N and b(l) represent the bandwidth requirement on l ∈ L.

## III. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

### A. Objectives
C(G) and R(G) represent the cost and the revenue of embedding a VNF-FG, respectively.
bl(l) represents the total amount of bandwidth resources allocated to virtual link l on the substrate link l, α and β are weighting coefficients for C(G), while γ and δ are weighting coefficients for R(G) for bandwidth and computing resources respectively.

The average embedding cost C¯(t) and total revenue R(t) at time t.
where G(t) is the set of VNF-FGs that have been embedded successfully before t. To allow efficient resource sharing among customized services, C¯(t) should be minimized, while the total revenue R(t) should be maximized.

### C. VNF Forward Graph Embedding
For the node embedding, one tries to find a mapping relation, MN : N → N, from a virtual node to a substrate node, such that for all n ∈ N, we have MN(n) ∈ N.
(9) ensures that the VNF corresponding to n can be hosted on the substrate node to which n is embedded.
Constraint (10) guarantees that the CPU processing resource
requirement of n can be satisfied.
