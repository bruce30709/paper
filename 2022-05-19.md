## III. SOFTWARE-DEFINED TRANSMISSION PROTOCOL
Based on the idea of NF tenants, a service chain defines a set of functions to process packets across one or more tenants.
If packet is being transferred is owned by a different tenant, the manager will copy the packet to another memory pool.
The tenants are isolated from each other and cannot eavesdrop on packets not destined for them.

If packets arriving at the host are destined for different NFs at the start of their service chain? 
Could solved by using a simple router inside NFManager, it retrieves incoming packets from the NIC and copies them into the pool of the appropriate tenant.
May negatively affecting performance, requires an additional CPU core that polls for packets, not a good idea.
Using P4 for packet routing! 
Incoming packet simply requires matching a portion of the header

High degree of parallelism in the SmartNIC allows it to perform this functionality with high throughput
Performing the work on the NIC frees up CPU cores for other purposes
May be possible to fully process a packet on the NIC, reduce latency by avoiding the DMA and CPU in some case
