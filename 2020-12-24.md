## I. INTRODUCTION
Current transport-layer protocols rely on end hosts to detect packet loss and perform packet retransmission. With SDN, it is essential to investigate how transport-layer protocols can be enhanced to perform prompt packet loss (or congestion) detection and recovery. 

###  Contributions
<span class="blue">**Contributions**</span>
:::info
•Connection establishment – We propose an SDN-based two-way connection establishment procedure for each pair of end hosts. With SDN controller, signaling exchanges for establishing each E2E connection are migrated to the control plane to save resources for data transmissions. Compared with the TCP three-way handshake, the proposed procedure reduces the amount of signaling exchanges overhead for establishing bi-directional connections.
:::
:::info
• Data transmission – We design a new header format to support efficient data transmission, in-path caching and retransmission. On one hand, unnecessary fields in the TCP/IP header are removed because the controller can offload partial functions from switches in data plane. On the other hand, we introduce new fields to support advanced protocol function elements, such as packet caching and receiver-triggered packet retransmission, which is different from the conventional TCP.
:::
:::info
• Caching-based packet retransmission – A novel in-path receiver-based packet loss detection and caching-based packet retransmission scheme is proposed to achieve inpath congestion detection and fast recovery of lost packets with low signaling overhead, which further reduces E2E packet transmission delay especially when congestion happens. The receiver-triggered packet retransmission is promising in terms of short response delay in packet loss detection and in reducing state management complexity at sender sides.

### B. Caching and Retransmission Function Element

**Caching Function Element**
:::warning
After a packet is processed by the node, it is cached (i.e. copied) in its caching buffer. Each cached packet is used for in-network early retransmission if the packet is lost on a network path, instead of being retransmitted from the sender side.
:::

**Retransmission Function Element**
:::warning
A retransmission node refers to an in-path switch with the functionalities of inpath packet loss detection and retransmission triggering.We define one cachingretransmission (CR) segment as a network segment including one retransmission node
:::
### C. Caching and Retransmission Placement
The sending edge switch is equipped with the caching function element, while the receiving edge switch enables both caching and retransmission function elements.

Caching functions are activated at the switch nodes before links with high packet loss probabilities, and then some of these caching nodes are selected for retransmission function activation.


To balance resource utilization of different CR segments, we choose retransmission nodes so that the packet loss probabilities over each segment are approximately equalized, named the equalized loss probability (EP) policy.

### A. Connection Establishment

1. Sending edge switch 1 receives a synchronous (SYN) packet sent by end host A.


2. <span class="red">Edge switch 1 encapsulates the SYN packet into an OpenFlow packet (i.e., Packet-in) and sends it to the SDN controller.</span> This process can be implemented by configuring a new flow entry specific for SYN packets in the edge switch. This flow entry points to an encapsulation action.


3. The controller receives and parses the OpenFlow packet, and then checks the path reachability according to a table of local link status. <span class="red">If there is a reachable path, the controller continues to forward this packet to receiving edge switch 8 through another OpenFlow packet (Packet-out),</span> and then the receiving edge switch abstracts the pure SYN packet and sends it to end host B. If there is no available path, the controller deploys a new path. The path calculation is based on the SDT algorithm. 


4. A similar process is conducted for sending back the SYNAcknowledgement (ACK) packet, where the SDN controller checks the reachability for establishing a reverse connection.


5. (Additional)To be compatible with conventional TCP employed by end hosts, we make some patch processing. That is to notify end host B, by an additional ACK packet, that the connection establishment is accomplished. Note that the ACK packet does not come from end host A, but is triggered by the receiving edge switch. At the same time, the sending edge switch requires to drop the ACK packet received from end host A directly.


### B. Data Transmission
![](https://i.imgur.com/T6UeC9F.png)
A new packet header format includeing 24-byte required fields and 20-byte optional field.

Some fields in the TCP/IP header are removed since the controller can offload partial functions from switches in the data plane.

Two new fields, Flag and Optional fields, are added into the SDTP header for new functionalities different from the conventional TCP, such as in-path caching and caching-based retransmission.

Different types of SDTP packets are identified by the field of Flag, including <span class="red">retransmission request (RR) packet, retransmission data (RD) packet, retransmissi on information (RI) packet, and caching notification (CN) packet.</span> The optional field contains different information for different types.

### C. Caching-Based Packet Retransmission
 1. Terminology for Packet Loss Detection:
    After the connection establishment for a pair of E2E hosts, a content window list and an expected packet list are maintained at each retransmission node for packet loss recovery.
    
    #### Content Window List 
    
    :::warning
    A content window list is established to record the packets already received by a retransmission node.    
    
    A number of packets received in sequence can be described by one window, where the $left\ edge$ of the window indicates the first sequence number of the received packets and the $right\ edge$ of the window is the next expected sequence number of the last received packet. When packets are not received in sequence, several content windows are generated, and each entry in the list represents a single window. 
    :::
    #### Expected Packet List 
    
    :::warning
    An expected packet list is used to record the information of packets that are expected by a retransmission node.
    
    The expected packet list has the following information fields:
    After packet loss is detected and a retransmission is triggered, the node refers to the expected packet list to sort out the lost packets to be retransmitted. 
    
    :::
    
    $1)$ $Num$ – When packets are lost discontinuously, different portions of expected packets are inserted into the expected list as different entries. The *Num* field records the sequence of the entries.
    $2)$ $StartSeq\ and\ EndSeq$ – Specifying an interval with a start sequence number and an end sequence number.
    $3)$ $StartNum$ – A pointer indicating the number of packet offset from the packet with the sequence number equaling *StartSeq*, with initial value 0.
    $4)$ $InterCnt$ – A packet interarrival counter indicating the number of packets received after the last sequentially received packet, with initial value 0.
    $5)$ $CntThres$ – A threshold for *InterCnt* to detect packet loss, with initial value 1.
    $6)$ $WaitLen$ – Measuring the difference between *CntThres* and *InterCnt*, with initial value 1.
    $7)$ $RTCnt$ – Counting how many retransmission requests of lost packets are sent, with initial value 0.
    $8)$ $RTType$ – Defining how packet loss is detected.
    $9)$ $RTTimer$ – The time elapses from the instant that a retransmission request is sent to the instant that the retransmitted packet is received.

    *StartSeq* and *EndSeq* are established based on the *right edge* of corresponding content window and *left edge* of its subsequent content window at a retransmission node. If both *StartSeq* and *EndSeq* are specified, the packets with the sequence numbers falling between *StartSeq* and *EndSeq* are the expected packets. If *EndSeq* is not determined (set as infinity), we use *StartSeq* and *StartNum* to locate a specific expected packet.
    
    The time duration between consecutive packet reception at a retransmission node is interarrival time, denoted as $InterTime$ and reset to 0 whenever a new packet is received. If the recorded *InterTime* is larger than a threshold, packet loss due to link congestion is detected.
    
2. Thresholds for Packet Loss Detection:
    The original packet loss is triggered by *InterTime* exceeding a thresholdor the number of received disordered packets exceeding athreshold. For retransmission packet loss detection, retransmission RTT is measured for timeout detection.
    #### Interarrival Timeout 
    We define the threshold for packet interarrival timeout as expected interarrival time, which indicates that packet loss is detected when InterTime is greaterthan the expected interarrival time.
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/pBHlDP4.png)
    >∆TE is an estimated expected interarrival time
    ∆T is the sending interval(40ms)
    ∆TS is one sample of an interarrival time(last time)
    a = 0.875
    b = 0.375
    
    If retransmission is triggered by the interarrival timeout, the packet in the expected packet list with smallest WaitLen that has not been retransmitted is selected for retransmission.
    #### Interarrival Counter Threshold 
    Since the RD packet also leads to disordered packet reception at the following segments, the following retransmission nodes should estimate an updated packet disorder length (CntThres) to avoid spurious packet loss detection. 
    
    we determine two-level packet interarrival counter threshold: One is packet-level CntThres which is differentiated for each packet, and the other is segment-level CntThres that is differentiated for each segment.
    
    To compute packet-level CntThres, packet retransmission information needs to be shared. If the retransmission node in the k th CR segment sends an RR packet, the node also sends an RI packet to its following retransmission nodes. The main fields in an RI packet is shown in Fig. 4. AddL (i.e., additional packet disorder length) is computed at the k th retransmission node to estimate how many packets are transmitted ahead of an RD packet.
    
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/6TdAYNY.png)
    
    additional packet disorder length (AddL), Lk, is calculated as
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Jpxi9vG.png)
    where Rk is the retransmission RTT and Ik is expected interarrival time at the k th retransmission node; ak is dependent on different retransmission trigger, 1 for InterCnt exceeding CntThres and 0 for packet interarrival timeout.
    
    #### Retransmission Timeout 
    After packet loss is detected, both the transmitted RR and RD packets can be lost during the retransmission phase.
    
    To determine a threshold for retransmission timeout, each packet retransmission delay (i.e., retransmission RTT) is sampled to estimate an expected retransmission RTT, given by 
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/cQdHOtZ.png)
    where R(k) is the k th retransmission RTT sample, Rv(k) is an expected retransmission RTT calculated from k samples, Rm(k) is a mean deviation from k retransmission RTT samples, Rth(k + 1) is the updated threshold for retransmission timeout (i.e., expected retransmission RTT) after the (k+ 1)th retransmission RTT sample, Rv(0) = R(1), Rm(0) = 0, ξ = 0.125, δ = 0.25, and φ = 4.

3. Retransmission Nodes Triggering RR Packets:
    After a retransmission node detects packet loss, it sends an RR packet to the preceding caching node, requesting the retransmission of the lost packet(s). If the retransmission is triggered by a packet-level interarrival counter threshold, the node also needs to generate and send an RI packet downstream to the following retransmission nodes at the same time. Main fields of the RR packet are similar to those of RI packet, expect that AddL is replaced by the Timestamp field, which records the time of sending an RR packet. The Flag field also indicates how an RR packet is triggered. For RR packets triggered by interarrival counter threshold \(C\) and retransmission timeout \(R\), StartSeq and EndSeq specify that the packets with the sequence numbers lying in between StartSeq and EndSeq are expected to be retransmitted; For RR packets triggered by interarrival timeout (T) where EndSeq fields are unknown, we use StartSeq and StartNum to locate each specific expected packet to be retransmitted.
5. Caching Nodes Retransmitting RD Packets:
    When a caching node receives an RR packet, a range of sequence numbers for the requested packets can be obtained from the RR packet. The caching node searches in its data caching buffer for the requested packets. If the requested packets are successfully cached and are not triggered by the same condition (i.e., interarrival timeout or interarrival counter threshold), the RD packets are sent out. Similar to RR packets, each RD packet includes the timestamp fields, for the retransmission timeout detection in case of retransmitted packet loss, and includes the values of StartSeq and StartNum from its received RR packet and the requested data payload; If the requested packets are not found in current caching node, the RR packet is forwarded to each preceding caching node consecutively until the packets are found in the current CR segment.
