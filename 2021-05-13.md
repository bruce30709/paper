VNF SECURITY POLICIES IN CLOUD NETWORK

A VNF intrusion detection system (IDS) before VNF firewall is sub-optimal since the firewall can filter out part of traffic, which needs to be mirrored for intrusion detection thus reduce traffic volume to be mirrored for intrusion detection. Additionally, some network functions such as IDS and network-probe involve only mirroring or passive monitoring of network traffic. Since they involve no modification to the packet header, they can be operated in parallel.
