## 1. INTRODUCTION
Anonymity systems are critical in achieving free, open communication on today’s Internet. Tor in particular has become a staple in resisting censorship and allowing journalists to safely communicate with their sources.

We present Bento, a novel architecture that augments Tor by allowing relays to act as user-programmable “middleboxes.” Bento allows clients to write sophisticated middlebox “functions” in a high-level language (Python, in our implementation) and run them on willing Tor relays. For example, we present a basic network function that adds bidirectional cover traffic to a circuit, thereby temporarily achieving stronger anonymity for a subset of the users at the cost of increased bandwidth consumption.

Contributions We make the following contributions:
* We introduce the first architecture to safely bring the power of NFV to anonymity networks like Tor. Critical to many of the security guarantees of our architecture are recent developments in trusted execution environments.
* We identify, design, and implement critical components that are necessary to ensure expressiveness and safety of an anonymous middlebox architecture. Although we focus on Tor, many of these components are broadly applicable.
* We present middlebox functions that solve a wide diversity of problems that have long plagued the Tor network, including website fingerprinting defenses and more robust hidden services.
* We evaluate our prototype architecture and functions on the live Tor network and show that it extends Tor’s capabilities and defenses while adding nominal performance overhead.
## 2. OVERVIEW OF BENTO

Figure 1: Overview of installing, and executing a Browser “function” that runs on an exit node, downloads a given URL, and delivers it, padded to some threshold number of bytes. To an attacker sniffing the client’s link, it appears the client uploads a small amount and then downloads a large amount.

Figure 2: Example of composing two functions: Browser runs a web client to download a website, and Dropbox stores a piece of data to later be fetched.

**Why This Helps** An attacker observing Alice’s communication sees one small upload from Alice (when she installs and executes the function), followed by a large download (the padded website).

Thus, because Alice is not actively involved during the download of the website, the attacker cannot gain any of the informative traffic dynamics that prior fingerprinting techniques require.

There are many other ways to combat website fingerprinting, but all of them require changes to Tor, clients, or web servers—an architecture like the one described here would greatly facilitate
development and deployment.

**Are We Nuts?** This example shows that a programmable Tor would be useful, but is it worth the risk of Tor relay operators to run unvetted code (from anonymous sources)? Is it safe for users to run sensitive tasks on other users’ devices?

Traditional NFV has not had to address such issues, because network management is typically not performed in adversarial settings. Addressing these safety concerns (and hopefully opening up a new space to apply NFV) is Bento’s central aim. We describe our design goals next.
## 3. BENTO GOAL
**Protect functions from middlebox** nodes We must protect users’ functions against confidentiality and integrity attacks on untrusted third-party middleboxes. 

**Protect middlebox nodes from functions** We must also protect the users who run the middlebox nodes.

**No Harm to Underlying Tor** Deploying Bento should cause no degradation to the existing anonymity properties of Tor.

**No Extensions to Tor** We aim to sit strictly on top of Tor, and to require no additional user privileges, so as to support more robust applications.
## 4. BENTO DESIGN

Design of a Bento middlebox node. Bento sits above an unmodified Tor, and augments it with programmable middleboxes to the Tor network. (Purple arrows denote Tor traffic; orange arrows denote Bento traffic.)
### 4.1 Functions
We have two competing goals with functions: On the one hand, they should be expressive enough to permit new, sophisticated features, services, and defenses. On the other hand, they should also be restrained from running completely arbitrary code on Tor relays or otherwise potentially compromising
Tor’s anonymity and security guarantees.
### 4.2 Bento Server
Bento servers spawn and manage a dedicated container for each client’s function, and forward traffic to the appropriate container.

Containers protect server operators from functions that (maliciously or inadvertently) over-consume resources, access sensitive files, or interfere with other functions running on the same machine.

Additionally, Bento servers expose (and mediate access to) interfaces to system resources, including an optional narrow interface to the server’s Tor relay. Finally, Bento empowers its operators with the ability to control what sorts of tasks they will perform on behalf of others.

Bento servers protect the confidentiality and integrity of a client’s function and associated data from the untrusted Bento operator by
allowing them to execute in Intel SGX enclaves within the container. This has the added benefit of providing plausible deniability to the Bento operators with respect to a function’s processing of abusive content.
### 4.3 Container Management
Bento operators are responsible for providing container images.  

**Initializing and Shutdown** When a Bento client connects to a Bento server, it requests a container image. The server spawns the container and returns to the client two tokens: an invocation token and a shutdown token. From this point onward, the client
includes the invocation token in subsequent messages, and the server forwards the messages to the corresponding server running in the container.

The Bento server terminates and reclaims the container’s resources either when the container’s function terminates, or the client presents the shutdown token.

**Sandboxing and Resource Accounting**
Bento servers use Linux’s cgroup and namespace features to provide containers with a nominal amount of memory and limited space in a chrooted file system, so that clients cannot access any files but their own.

To ensure that functions cannot violate a Tor relay’s exit node policies, the Bento server converts the exit node policies into analogous iptable rules, and applies these rules to each container. 

Bento also permits operators to apply system call
filters in the form of seccomp policies to disallow a function’s use of specific system calls, such as fork and execve.

**Container Interface to Tor Instance** We envision policies that middlebox node operators may wish to enforce that cannot be satisfied using OS-level sandboxing techniques alone.
### 4.4 Standard Container Images
**Python-OP-SGX container** The Python-OP-SGX container is similar to the Python container, but instead executes the Python application, as well as an optional companion Onion Proxy, in Intel SGX enclaves by using a library OS for running unmodified applications in SGX. In this way, the container guarantees the confidentiality and integrity of the application’s memory.

Our implementation specifically makes use of conclaves (“containers of enclaves”), which allow for arbitrary legacy applications to be deployed within a set of interconnected enclaves, where
some enclaves securely provide traditional OS services on behalf of the enclaved application, such as an encrypted and integrityprotected filesystem. In Figure 3, we refer to such an enclaved filesystem as FS Protect

FS Protect generates an ephemeral encryption key when the filesystem is launched in an enclave; the container ensures that the enclaved filesystem is the only writable filesystem available to
the function, and therefore that all filesystem writes are encrypted.

Prior to function execution, the Bento client attests the container’s image and establishes a secure TLS channel to the container’s function loader; the Bento client then uploads the function, and any associated data to copy to FS Protect, over this channel. In addition to securing the client’s on disk content, FS Protect simultaneously
provides the Bento operator with plausible deniability in the event that the function uses abusive content, as, much like Tor traffic, the
function’s execution and on-disk resources are unobservable by the operator.

### 4.5 Middlebox Node Policies
Allowing other users to run custom software on one’s own machine has obvious risks, particularly in the context of an anonymous network such as Tor. For any such architecture to be viable, it must
give users power to assert what they are and are not willing to do on behalf of others. Tor itself runs into this challenge with respect to
exit nodes: not all users are willing to connect to any service on any machine. Tor’s solution to this is exit node policies: fine-grained policies of which IP addresses and ports it will or will not visit on behalf of other Tor users.
We borrow this idea and introduce middlebox node policies. At a high level, these are similar to exit node policies: middleboxes specify what they are and are not willing to perform on behalf
of others. The primary difference is the set of actions the policies themselves span.

## 5. BENTO’S SECURITY PROPERTIES

### 5.1 Attacks Against Functions
One of our primary goals is to protect functions from middleboxes, and from other functions running on those middleboxes. We envision two classes of attack:

The first class involves altering or exfiltrating data or code as it executes. Conclaves give Bento strong guarantees of confidentiality and integrity , subject to the reliability of the trusted hardware. Data stored (and code run) in a conclave is protected against inspection and tampering from both other applications and an adversary with physical access. Thus, even if a middlebox and adversarial function were to collude, the code and data are protected. 

Alternatively, an attacker might try to inject packets into a function that he himself does not control. We prevent this attack through the invocation token provided on function load. This token is then required to direct any further communication or requests to the
running function).
### 5.2 Attacks Against Middleboxes
**Running arbitrary code** One of the benefits of Bento is its ability to allow for arbitrary code. This of course brings with it concern that third-party programs may run amok. Bento does not seek
to limit what a third-party program can do within a container, but rather what side-effects it can have on the system itself.

**Resource exhaustion attacks** A malicious function could try to consume a large amount of resources on a Bento box. Our OS-level sandboxing mitigates this, as it allows us to restrict the maximum level of resource consumption of the processes running in the sandbox.

**Abusive functions** Bento has several safeguards to protect against abusive functions. For instance, by adopting the relay’s exit node policy (§5.3), Bento restricts the parties with which a function can communicate.

### 5.3 Attacks Against Users
As many users employ Tor specifically to protect their anonymity, we must be careful that Bento does not compromise this. To discuss the various deanonymization challenges a user might face (and
why Bento protects against them), we will briefly walk through the life cycle of a user’s interaction with Bento.

A user must first fetch the middlebox node policy for its chosen Bento server. This could be done over a Tor circuit if the user wishes to hide that she is using Bento. She also obtains the attestation verification report, to ensure that the node is setup correctly.

Next, the user uploads her function. Note that a node operator should not be able to link function uploads to a specific user (or even identify them) as there is nothing fingerprintable about uploads in terms of the code itself. For maximum privacy, function uploads could also be encrypted and only decrypted within the enclave. The node then returns the necessary tokens to the user.

When the user wishes to run her function, she sends her messages to it with the (blinded) invocation token. We note that preventing a malicious operator from fingerprinting a function’s system call patterns, network calls, and the like in order to identify what function a user is running (or identify that two separately uploaded functions are actually the same) is outside of the scope of this paper. We believe techniques that build oblivious filesystems for SGX would be applicable here. While a network adversary might be able to tell that a Bento node is running a function, he will not be able to link this function back to the specific user who uploaded and invoked it, as a privacy-conscious user only interacts
with the node over Tor circuits.

Finally, when the user is done with her function, she uses the (blinded) shutdown token to terminate it.

padding.
## 7. CASE STUDY: HIDDEN SERVICE LOAD BALANCER

The LoadBalancer function forwards requests from
the Introduction Point to one of its hidden service replicas. In our implementation, LoadBalancer automatically scales the replicas up and down to meet demands.

The plot on the left shows per client download speed without the LoadBalancer while the plot on the right demonstrates the benefit from utilizing our function. As more clients access the hidden service, additional replicas are spun up to handle the load.
